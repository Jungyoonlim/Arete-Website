        <h3>We are building Virtue Ethics API models to seemlessly integrate with AI systems, an AI alignment solution inspired
            by the wisdom of Aristotle and his predecessors and powered by reinforcement learning from human preferences. Our mission is to develop APIs that enable AI systems to align with human values, promoting the virtues of wisdom, courage,
            justice, and temperance.
